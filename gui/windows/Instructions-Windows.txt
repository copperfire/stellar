Instructions for Running Kelp GUI on Windows
============================================

You need to enable the WSL feature (Windows Subsystem for Linux) offered by Windows and also install a linux distribution such as Ubuntu. Here are the steps to do that:
1. To do this you can right-click the "1-Install-WSL.ps1" script and click on "Run with PowerShell". If it asks for permissions to run scripts then enter "Y" on your keyboard so the PowerShell window can run this script.
    i. This will download Ubuntu 18.04 LTS which is 230MB so can take some time.
   ii. Restart your computer after this step for WSL changes to be applied correctly.
2. Run the "2-default-wsl-version1.bat" script so it defaults to using version 1 of WSL.
3. Run the "1-Install-WSL.ps1" script again by right-clicking on the script and selecting "Run with PowerShell". This will attempt to install "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS" in case it failed in the first attempt in step 1..
    i. Once the installation is completed then you will need to set up your username and password for this new Ubuntu installation.
   ii. Restart your computer after this step for Ubuntu changes to be applied correctly.

Now you can run Kelp GUI by double-clicking on the "3-kelp-start-windows.bat" script. You can use this script every time you want to start Kelp GUI.
